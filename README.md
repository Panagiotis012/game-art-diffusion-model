# Game Art Diffusion Model
**Open-source diffusion model for stylized 2D game-art (Hollow-Knight-inspired).**

This project aims to train a custom diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, stylized game assets for indie developers.  
The model focuses on:

- 2D characters  
- enemies / bosses  
- environment pieces  
- props  
- animation-ready frames  
- stylized silhouettes and shading  

The goal is to create an accessible tool for indie game creators who need consistent, stylized art without depending on commercial models.

## Status
Work in progress — dataset preparation & training pipeline setup.

---

## Planned Deliverables
- Full model weights (safetensors)  
- Dataset curation pipeline  
- PyTorch training scripts  
- Inference scripts  
- HuggingFace model card  
- LoRA presets for different art styles  
- Demo notebook

## Why This Matters
There is currently no high-quality open-source model specialized in stylized 2D game art.  
Most indie developers rely on expensive commercial models or manually draw every asset.  

This project aims to make stylized game-art generation **accessible**, **affordable**, and **creator-friendly** for everyone.
