Game Art Diffusion Model

Open-source diffusion model for stylized 2D game-art (Hollow-Knight-inspired).

This project aims to train a custom diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, stylized game assets for indie developers.
The model will focus on:

2D characters

enemies / bosses

environment pieces

props

animation-ready frames

stylized silhouettes and shading

The goal is to create an accessible tool for indie game creators who need consistent, stylized art without depending on commercial models.

Status

Work in progress — preparing dataset and training pipeline.

Planned Deliverables

full model weights (safetensors)

dataset curation pipeline

PyTorch training scripts

inference scripts

HuggingFace model card

LoRA presets for different art styles

demo notebook

Why

There is no high-quality open-source model specialized in stylized 2D game art.
This project makes high-quality indie game art generation accessible to everyone.
